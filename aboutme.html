        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jean-Paul, but I just like to go by JP for short. My family is from the Dominican Republic and I served a mission in Madagascar.

I am a Data Science Major, and I would really love to focus on Machine Learning in my career, but I would also love to manage a team of data scientists in the near future. I nice thing at BYU-Idaho is that we have a great data science society, and the head of the data science department makes it possible to gain experience through real clients with actual work. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Like many I love BYU-Idaho not during the winters...but I love the atmosphere. I love how professor get close with the students and I love how they want us to succeed as students.

  <p>I know that the skills in web development will help my career because with my current job I'm realizing more and more that you need web deployment skills, not just math and programming skills.
