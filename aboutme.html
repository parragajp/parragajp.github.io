        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jean-Paul, but I just like to go by JP for short. My family is from the Dominican Republic and I served a mission in Madagascar.

I just graduated and I was a Data Science Major, and I would really love to focus on Machine Learning in my career, but I would also love to manage a team of data scientists in the near future.
