      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Dekko  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        The reason why I want to use this is first I'm using it as a headline font for the white water rafting website and I really like it
        but the other reason is because I want this website to reflect like a blog and I want people to feel like this is journey.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Actor  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I'm choosing this font because I think the font is kind of like the font of writing in the terminal command line on the computer.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The industry is using a lot of Xgboost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks Algorithms to do A.I., Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. All great algorithms but it's not like one algorithm trumps the other.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        The length of the projects vary between 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. If you want to regulary contract us then we can set up a regular subscription plan.

       <li>-Data Mining Section: Data mining is the study of historical data and it can be visually communicated. 
        Data mining process includes a number of tasks such as association, classification, prediction, clustering, 
        time series analysis and so on. Data mining helps businesses understand which marketing campaigns 
        will likely generate the most engagement, classify customers, display personalized advertisements, 
        and optimize marketing spend. Understanding the past is crucial to make informed decisions.</li>

        <p></p>

        <li>-Data Collection Section: It all begins with a question. 
            Can a new hire increase pizza delivery time by 10 minutes, 30 min, etc..? 
            How can I increase the efficiency of my marketing team? 
            No matter what, data is the answer. Through data mining, 
            we can collect the information to answer those questions. In order to make an informed decision 1, 3, 
            to 6 months of data is collected. 
            From relational to non-relational databases we can properly organize your data to visualize, study, and predict your data.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>-Jobs Sold ML API Service section: Simple API Service that let's you send new instances of jobs against my random forest model built in scikit-learn.
                The exact price of the job cannot be inputed because it throws off the prediciton. Thus, the price of the job had to be separated into groups. It's all about getting the right of markup within a certain job cost.</li>

                <p></p>
    
            <li>-Endpoints section: / or /about - shows info about the api service, /isAlive - shows "Yessir!" if service is up and running, 
                predictapi - api where you send params of a new job instance and it returns a prediction</li>

                <p></p>
            
    <li>-Example section: here's an example how the url request will look like http://localhost:1001/predict?markup=.2&type_NotFromClustGroup=1&type_76000_plus=1&type_Referral=1</li>
