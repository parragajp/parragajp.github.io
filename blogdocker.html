      <p>
          I want to preface that Docker is a great tool and it serves many purposes. In this blog post I want to explain
          how I was able to host a SQL Server Database through <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> and 
          <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google's Cloud Platform.</a> I will talk about my thoughts about each of
          these tools and then I'll go a little more in depth of what exactly each tool is and then I'll summarize the steps I took
          to deploy MSSQL Database using both tools.
      </p>


      <h3>Thoughts on GCloud</h3>
      <p>
          One thing that I have come to learn while doing school and work that nothing is free in this world. It's a difficult
          truth that I've come to accept. Sometimes it's okay to pay money for something that you just don't have the expertise to do.
          This is where Google Cloud Platform comes into play. Google Cloud Platform solves many obstacles. I think GCloud modernizes
          cloud infrastructure and runs important things like VMware, Oracle, MSSQL, and Operating Systems. With Databases it can manage
          data while being secure and reliable.
      </p>

      <h3>Thoughts on Docker</h3>
      <p>
        I'm very new to software development and it's something that is not easy for me. However,
        I get really excited when software development is stress free and you know what is stress free? Docker!
        Like their website says, "Docker delivers applications <strong>hassle free</strong> and helps devlopers conquer the complexity
        of app development. We <strong>simplify</strong> and <strong>accelerate</strong> workflows." I love this.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Docker?</h2>

      <p>
          Docker is a software platform that makes easy the building, running, maintaining, and transfering of applications. Docker
          does this by virtualizing an operating system of the computer you are using.
      </p>

      <h3>How does Docker solve the software process?</h3>

      <p>
          Take for example python. If your company has 3 python developers and they're using 3 different versions of Python and you want to deploy their
          apps how do you host all 3 apps on the same server? Keep in mind that each app has different dependencies because they probably use different
          computers/operating systems and different python editors. The solution is Docker! What your company could do is save these apps into containers which
          copies the dependencies and the operating system and virtualizes them. Basically your host could share these containers all in the same place.
      </p>
      <p>
          A cool thing is that Docker can run in any operating system. You can pass different docker containers to different computers and it doesn't
          matter what computer you are using.
      </p>

      <h3>My Docker Container</h3>

      <p>
          In my case I created a Microsoft SQL Instance in Docker. I can remotely connect to it and create tables, query the data,
          and create as many databases as I want. I can save this SQL instance and put it into a container and move it around. Now,
          I'm just thinking ahead here. I developed a Database in the first place because at my work we're switching databases and we 
          need a better way to retrieve data because the old database is a non-relational database and SQL databases are relational so it's
          easier to retrieve information. I first developed the instance on docker and I can change the instance by remotely connecting into. I can
          save it and transfer it to wherever I like. When I leave the company that docker SQL instance can be saved and moved around as many times
          it needs to be and in the future in won't matter if you're on Mac or Windows to remotely connect to it. If for example I developed a database
          but it was developed in Windows obviously because it's made by Microsoft, you could technically save the database into a .bak file but that database
          could only be restored through someone that has a windows pc and if they had Microsoft's management studio. The other thing is that database could only
          be hosted throught Microsoft's cloud services but what if the company I work for doesn't use any stuff like that? In making the SQL instance 
          with docker, this docker container can be moved anywhere, on any computer, on any hosting services, and on any application platform. Docker makes things
          versatile, easy, and flexible.
